### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a Master's degree student in computer science at Laval University. Moreover, I have completed a B.Sc. in physics at the same university in parallel with a certificate in computer science. My master project consists in designing a python library that joins machine learning and neuroscience. This library, [NeuroTorch](https://github.com/NeuroTorch), allows, among other things, to use biologically realistic dynamics, such as spiking neural networks, in order to perform machine learning tasks.

I am also the co-founder of [PhysXGamesStudio](https://github.com/PhysX-Games), a new organization creating video games using machine learning. In addition, we are considering putting some of our development tools on the Unreal Engine marketplace.

Finally, I'm currently looking for a PhD project, so if you have an opportunity for me, do not hesitate to contact me.


Summary:
--------
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [NeuroTorch](https://github.com/NeuroTorch) and [PhysXGamesStudio](https://github.com/PhysX-Games).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Game developpement.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a PhD project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Game dev or Artist in [PhysXGamesStudio](https://github.com/PhysX-Games).
