### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I am currently a Ph.D. student in physics at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke, specializing in quantum machine learning. My current research involves developing the [MatchCake](https://github.com/MatchCake) package, which is designed for Fermionic Quantum Computing and Fermionic Machine Learning. My academic journey includes a Master's degree in computer science from UniversitÃ© Laval, where I also completed a B.Sc. in physics concurrently with a certificate in computer science.

ðŸ§  My master's project involved the development of [NeuroTorch](https://github.com/NeuroTorch), a Python library that seamlessly integrates machine learning and neuroscience. This innovative library empowers users to leverage biologically realistic dynamics, including spiking neural networks, for various machine learning tasks.

ðŸš€ Co-founder of [PhysXGamesStudio](https://github.com/PhysX-Games), an organization dedicated to crafting video games through the application of machine learning. We are actively exploring opportunities to share some of our development tools on the Unreal Engine marketplace.

Excited to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technology at the intersection of physics, computer science, and quantum machine learning. ðŸŒŒðŸ¤– Let's connect and collaborate! ðŸš€


Summary:
--------
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [PhysXGamesStudio](https://github.com/PhysX-Games), [MatchCake](https://github.com/MatchCake) and [NeuroTorch](https://github.com/NeuroTorch).
